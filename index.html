      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="about-grid">
        <p>I’m a <strong>Resarcher</strong> I have completed my Bachelor’s degree in the field of Software Engineering from Karakorum 
International University. I basically belong to an under develop area of Pakistan namely Gilgit
Baltistan however, to pursue my professional career in software engineering, I moved to 
Karachi which is known for city of plenty opportunities. Currently, I am associated with Ramada 
bywhandham Gilgit Resort as an IT Officer. 
My father was working as a clerk in a Pakistan Army where soldiers were not used to tech/ 
smart ways and he used to perform his duties manually. I was realized I could overcome my 
father efforts. I planned   to go through in software engineering field, at that time.  
In secondary school studies, I have been awarded awards and tuition fee waiver. In higher 
secondary education, Government waived my fee and also provided me stipend. In addition to 
my studies during my college days, I availed an opportunity of certification namely-English 
Access Micro Scholarship Program and on successful completion of the same, I have been 
awarded with Graduate certification from US Embassy of Pakistan. I participated a poetry 
competition, Pakistan US Alumni network provided me a certificate. 
I was also a Boys Scout member and during my association with Boys scout, I participated in 
various community support/development initiatives which includes Cleanliness awareness 
program among masses, Disaster management exercises and also conducted awareness 
sessions related sustainable tourism. 
After successfully completing my higher secondary education, I got admission in university in a 
field about which I was preplanned. During my university days and resultantly University has 
given me scholarship for my remaining period. In addition to my studies, I completed 03 
months paid internship in Government sector and  various certifications related to my passion 
which includes Word press, Graphic designing, Digital marketing, Freelancing, Microsoft IT 
specialist and TOEFL ITP certifications. 
I want to pursue master degree program in IT field as this would take me closer to my dream 
and my dream is doing PhD in same field.  
My dedication and affiliation for Software Engineering needs further education in terms of MS 
and PhD and resultantly, after completion, I will give back to my society through my humble 
contribution which could be teaching IT aspirants and to create awareness about digitalization 
among marginalized community.</p>
